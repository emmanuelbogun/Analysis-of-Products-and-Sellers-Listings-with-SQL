# Analysis-of-Products-and-Sellers-Listings-with-SQL
 
## Introduction
In this project, SQL queries were used to analyze data related to sellers and their listings on an online marketplace.
## Data Injestion
The datasets were imported into the PostgreSQL database automatically after creating the tables manually. The process also involved the extraction of records from the external sources, which were four (4) CSV files, and finally populating the corresponding tables in the database. The tables were named **`brands`**, **`category`**, **`clicks`** and **`listings`** respectively using the internal query tool in pgAdmin. I also ensured the tables had the same column names as those in the csv file.
## Description of the Tables
<br> `listings`: **`id`** column indicates id of the listing started by seller. Completed listings are listings where sellers has finished listing process.</br>
<br> `clicks` : Rich data on behaviour on the listing form. One row is one click made by seller.</br>
<br> `brands` and `categories` : keys for the product attributes. </br>
## Data Analysis
In this section, I made used of SQL functions for analyzing the data. Some of them includes:
- **COUNT, SUM, MIN & MAX**
- **WHERE**
- **LIMIT**
- **GROUP BY**
- **ORDER BY**
- **JOINS**
- **CASE WHEN**
- **WITH**
- **COMMON TABLE EXPRESSIONS (CTEs)**

This analysis was used in answering the following business questions:
- Top 10 Brands with the most completed listings
- Per customer, show number of total listings started, listings completed and listings sold; order by listings started descending?
- Per customer, if True or False they listed items in Clothing, Bags, Shoes and Accessories categories?
- Per seller: date of their first listing, date of their last listing, date of last sale and name of last action (completed list/sale)?
- Median number of clicks made on listing form for submitted products?
- Per product that was not submitted : last seller's action on listing form?
## Action Insights
- The number of listings sold were very low compared to the number of listings started and completed. It would be recommended that the sellers make their prices reasonable depending on the product in question. They should also look at promotions and advertisement, as this can increase the productâ€™s visibility to potential customers which in turn leads to an increase in sales.
- For the product that were not submitted, about 81% of the sellers had either deleted their draft or pressed the back button. So, a strong and compelling call to action has to be implemented on the listing form so as to help in convincing the sellers in completing their listings.
- About 90% of listings by the customers belonged in the Clothing, Bags, Shoes and Accessories categories. Since they are more listings for these categories, marketing efforts for product in these categories can be enhanced. Sellers of products in other categories should also beencouraged to focus on retargeting advertisements to their potential audience.
